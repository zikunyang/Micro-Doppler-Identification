# Micro-Doppler-Identification

MicroDoppler with Supervised Learning is the deep learning code for MicroDoppler identification with traditional supervised learning algorithm.

MicroDoppler with DIM is the deep learning code for MicroDoppler identification with DIM algorithm.

The four .pth files are the trained neural networks. First the Convolutional net, connected with the Linear net.

The four Excel files are the experimental results of the trained neural networks.

mi_INCE is the mutual information estimator based on machine learning.
